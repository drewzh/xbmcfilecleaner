DANGER WILL ROBINSON!!!
=====================================
This script has the potential to wipe your entire video collection!  Please make sure you understand exactly what this script is designed to do before enabling the file deletion capabilities in the settings.  I will not be held responsible for loss of data due to user error.

DESCRIPTION
=====================================    
This plugin will automatically scan your library for watched TV shows and Movies and delete them from the file system based on numerous critia such as age, rating, disk free space etc.  All these options and more can be configured via add-on settings (right click addon or press C for context menu and select 'Add-on Settings').  Also make sure you set the disk usage path before enabling if you store your videos on a secondary drive (e.g, /media/external or D:\ etc).

QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/SUGGESTIONS

TO DO LIST
=====================================
* Create a single query depending on the type of file to delete (movie/episode). At the moment we write the same query twice, only slightly different.
* Do not catch each and every type of exception, but only the ones we will handle ourselves
* Fix low disk space measuring for non-Windows OSes
* Adjust all notification popups to use localized text strings

FUTURE IDEAS
=====================================
* Allow users to start the addon themselves using the "program addons" feature too.
* Display one message with the number of files deleted, if more than one, instead of displaying each message individually
