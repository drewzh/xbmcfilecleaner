[B][I]DESCRIPTION[/I][/B]
=====================================
This addon will automatically scan your library for watched TV shows and Movies and delete them from the file system based on numerous critia such as age, rating, free disk space, etc. All these options and more can be configured via the addon's settings. Also make sure you set the correct path to the disk you wish to check for free space, especially when you store your videos on a secondary drive or a network share.

[B][I]FUTURE IDEAS[/I][/B]
=====================================
* Allow users to start the addon themselves using the "program addons" feature too.
* Display one message with the number of files deleted, if more than one, instead of displaying each message individually
* Delete files after a user-determined number of plays instead of the fixed one play
